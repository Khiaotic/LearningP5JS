## ✨Overview (description)✨
<h3 align="center">My first p5.js project in my Creative Tech Course. I remixed a  "Microscope Simuulator TKt" by Tan Kian-tiong (rainsr7235). 
  I took this approach to learn the language model, but also give it a real world use. I remixed the project with intentions of using it as a "Thank You" to donors 
  of my ankle fracture GoFundMe. I can see the potential of p5.js as a creative tech. </h3>
